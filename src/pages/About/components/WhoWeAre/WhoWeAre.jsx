        UC Berkeley is known both for its world-famous Computer Science
        program as well as its rich history of political advocacy by its
        student body. Political Computer Science at Berkeley provides students
        with a space to tap into both of these backgrounds. We are a community
        of students interested in computer and political science––and more
        specifically, the intersection of these two important fields.
